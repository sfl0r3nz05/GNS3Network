To perform the right deployment follow each of the following steps:

1. We assume that we have an EC2 instance deployed with Ubuntu Server 20.04 as OS:

2. The following rules apply for opening incoming connections from:

    | Type        | Port      | Description                                                     |
    |-------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | SSH         | 22        | Instance management                                             |
    | Custom TCP  | 3080      | GNS3 client-server connection                                   |
    | Custom TCP  | 5000-5030 | Telnet connection for the device management created within GNS3 |

3. GNS3 server installation:

    ```console
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gns3/ppa
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install gns3-gui gns3 server
    ```

4. Add IOU support::

    ```console
    sudo dpkg â€“add-architcture i386
    sudo apt install gns3-iou
    ```

## To Do

1. Enable secure connection between the client and server via TLS
