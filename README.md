# GNS3 server configuration on an EC2 instance

The purpose of this repository is to deploy a GNS3 server on an EC2 instance of AWS. The following figure shows the basic architecture of the deployment to be implemented:

To perform the right deployment follow each of the following steps:

1. We assume that we have an EC2 instance deployed with Ubuntu Server 20.04 as OS:

2. The following rules apply for opening incoming connections from:

    | Type        | Port      | Description                                                     |
    |-------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | SSH         | 22        | Instance management                                             |
    | Custom TCP  | 3080      | GNS3 client-server connection                                   |
    | Custom TCP  | 5000-5030 | Telnet connection for the device management created within GNS3 |

    - Example of applied rules

3. GNS3 server installation:

    ```console
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gns3/ppa
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install gns3-server gns3-gui
    ```

    - It is recommended accept both options as part of the installation process:

4. IOU (IOS over Unix) is an internal Cisco tool for simulating the ASICs in Cisco Switches. This enables you to play with Layer 2 switching in the Labs:

    ```console
    sudo dpkg â€“add-architcture i386
    sudo apt install gns3-iou
    ```

## To Do

1. Enable secure connection between the client and server via TLS
