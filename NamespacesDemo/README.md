# Namespaces Demonstration

*Namespaces* are a feature of the Linux kernel that partitions kernel resources such that one set of processes sees one set of resources while another set of processes sees a different set of resources. In other words, the key feature of *namespaces* is that they isolate processes from each other. On a server where you are running many different services, isolating each service and its associated processes from other services means that there is a smaller blast radius for changes, as well as a smaller footprint for securityâ€‘related concerns. Mostly though, isolating services meets the architectural style of microservices as described.
